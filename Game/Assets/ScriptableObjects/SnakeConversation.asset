  - Disland? Disland is a funny place.
  - I have been caring to these here docks for years and I have seen many-a-strange.
  - Actually, I've been here my whole life. I was CURSED by this FOUL beast.
  - This foul beast locked me in this here shop behind this table that has NO DOOR
    OUT.
  - And now the beast is dead, so I am forever shackled here.
  - The only way to cure my disease is with the beautiful, crisp, water found in
    town.
  - Bring me some and I will make it worth your while.
